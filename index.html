  <div class="row">
  <p class="col-md-4">Welcome to the Portfolio of David Rowan. Ever since a child I have had a love for technology an especially computers. I wrote my first program when I was in the seventh grade. The excitment I felt from creating something from code is something I'd never experinced. I knew that coding was something that would remain apart of my life from that moment on.</p> 
     <p class="col-md-4"> I first went to college at Southern University of Baton Rouge studing as a Mechanical Engineer. After only completing 2 years I had to leave school to seek employment to help provide for my new born daughter. After leaving college I enrolled in a local Barber School. I promised myself that once I finished barber school I would enroll into college to continue my dream of becoming a computer programmer.</p>
    <p class="col-md-4">After opening my first barber shop I finally had the chance to enroll into college again. Once I begin to look at the courses available I chose Computer Networking to obtain my degree in. I figured if I had a full understanding of a computers code and it's network that would set my apart from the rest and add value to my knowledge. After graduating from college I remained in the barber shop. Before applying for coding jobs I wanted a full understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
